## Find gifs using this API: https://developers.giphy.com/

**I made it with react and redux.** 
**I used axios to fetch the data from the API.**
**React router dom to manage internal links and of course an API to get gifs**

### Quick Description :)
  - a form to search GIF by key words
  - a loader appears during data recovery
  - results displayed like a list of items (cards)
  - each cards can be clicked to display more informations
  - possibility to choose the application's theme 
  - store theme in local storage
  - possibility to filter results by import date
  - button to easy scroll top
  - button to get more results at the bottom of the results list

## TODO
 DONE 1. set router dom and clickable gif
2. set changing theme options (component)
3. set scroll to top option (component)
4. write some comments
